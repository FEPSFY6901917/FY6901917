      A vehicle’s aerodynamic properties play a critical role in its usability and how it performs in a multifaceted way. Aerodynamic optimisation (AO) ensures that manufacturers can employ modern proven solutions so that the next generation of automobiles can attain greater speeds, have a better fuel economy, are more stable at high speeds, have a minimized noise emission as well as better thermal performance. Wind tunnel testing (WTT) and Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) are the primary methods used by aerodynamicists to gauge an understanding as to how a certain car shape will behave in the presence of a fluid and the different airflow effects that the chassis may be subject to. CFD allows for engineers to continuously iterate and make micro-adjustments on a design and quickly and effectively, see the consequences of that alteration with regards to any changes in how the model behaves in the simulated fluid. Wind tunnels provide highly accurate data which verifies CFD results and gives engineers further insights as how a physical car model can perform in the real world all the while having a controlled environment where factor such as yaw angle (angle of attack) and wind speed can be closely adjusted and monitored.
